## Summary

Congratulations on making it through the walkthrough - that was by far the toughest one yet.

## Learning Objectives

If you can't answer **yes** to any of these points, then please go back and read through the walkthrough and any past lectures/walkthroughs until you can confidently answer them. Use Google if you need to and look at the [Jasmine docs](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html). The :bulb: sections are *very* important - don't ignore them!

You should be able to:

* Create a prototype/constructor object.
* Create a new instance of a prototype/constructor object.
* Understand callback functions and anonymous functions.
* Import Jasmine into a project.
* `describe` a set of tests.
* Use a `beforeEach` to instantiate objects.
* Use `it` to describe a test.
* Call methods on your objects.
* Inside `it`'s callback, make assertions on your objects methods.
* Run your tests.

As a bonus, you will be comfortable:

* Spying on an object's methods.
* Overriding return values of methods.
* Asserting that a method you are spying on has been called.
