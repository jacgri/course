Create a fully tested `Calculator` that can `add`, `subtract`, `divide` and `multiply` two numbers. 

You should adopt a 100% test-driven approach - no functioning code before a test is in place, and write the bare minimum amount of code necessary to make each test pass.

Please send a link to your finished GitHub repository in a DM on Slack.

## Test cases

`Calculator`

* `can add 2 numbers together`
* `can subtract a number from another number`
* `can multiply a number by another number`
* `can divide a number by another number`

Bonus:

```
As a busy person,
So I don't have to use my brain,
I'd like to work out the value of a number to the power of another number on a calculator.
```

```
As a busy person,
So I don't have to use my brain,
I'd like to work out the square root of a number on a calculator.
```

* `can work out the value of a number to the power of another number`
* `can work out the square root of a number`
