## Assignment

The assignment for this week is to use Express and MongoDB to create a guest book.

The guest book should have multiple inputs: a `person` text input, and a `comment` text input. When a person leaves a comment, their name and comment should appear on the page (and should persist on refresh).

You should be able to delete comments.

### Bonus points
* Store the current date on each document in a createdAt field.
* Sort the comments on the page by date in descending order (newest first).
