## Kindle

We are going to be creating an e-reader app that allows books to be read in the command line.

```
As a person,
So I can entertain myself,
I would like to read a chapter of a book.
```

```
As a person,
So I can keep track of where I've read to,
I would like to see a list of the chapters in a book.
```

```
As a person,
So I can find multiple books,
I would like to browse books in a library.
```

```
As a person who doesn't code,
So I can access the library and its books,
I would like an easy to use interface.
```
